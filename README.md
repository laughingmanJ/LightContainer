# LightContainer
Light Container is a IoC ([inversion of control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control)) container targeting .NET Standard for portability and use in .NET Framework (Windows) and .NET Core (Windows, Linux, Mac, and Xamarin) applications.  It is used as a dependency injector to help break up your application into loosely coupled and highly cohesive components for a better overall software architecture.  It is also designed to be small and light to not take up much space within an application’s footprint.  

:construction: The project is currently a work in progress and pre-version 1.
